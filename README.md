# Highstock for Bower.

`bower install highstock`

### In your HTML

`<script src="components/highstock/highstock.js"></script>`

or

`<script src="components/highstock/highstock.src.js"></script>`

Note that you no longer need to include Highcharts and Highstock separately. Highstock is a superset of Highcharts, so including Highstock with also include Highcharts.
